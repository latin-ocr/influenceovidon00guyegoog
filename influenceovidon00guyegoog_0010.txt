an interesting chapter in the critical study οἱ Crestien’s poen-is
After pointing out that Ovid's treatment οἱ love resembles chivalric
love as portrayed by Crestien, he closed his short discussion with
the statement that other analogies would easily be discovered by
anyone who would study the problem with care.² W. A. Nitze
mentions the “ evident analogies that the love situations of Crestieu's
poems offer to 0vid.¹¹¹ Karl Heyl⁴ speaks of Ovid as the leader
and master οἱ courtly poets in the Nortia οἱ France and indicates
some influentes οἱ Ovid on Crestien as one of a group οἱ writers
who took Ovid as an authority in matter and in form. Pio szna
points out a single case of Ovid's influente on Crestien’s PercevaU
Wilibald Schmetter* compares the beginning οἱ the lyric Amors,
tauron et bataille, attributed to Crestieu, to lines from Ovid's
Amores. Edmond Fara] suggests the need οἱ a comprehensive
study οἱ Ovid's influence on French literature of the second half
οἱ the 12th century, especially on Crestien de Troyes.''

The evidence in support of our major thesis will be presented
first in detail, the conclusion-ns to be deduced will then be set forth,
and lastly the incidental determination of a new chronology οἱ
Crestien's works will be elucidated.
