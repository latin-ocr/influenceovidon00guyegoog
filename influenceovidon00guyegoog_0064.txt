²³3 The Romam'c Review

They all stay up very late that night and the next morning Erec

was up
697 . . . lues que I'aube crieve.

A second night was spent at the home of the vavassor before Erec
returned with Enide to Arthur's court:

14²9 Cele nuit ont tote dormie.

No clement οἱ Ovidian love occurs in Erec except the idea that
love gives counge and strength and the suicide motis from the
Pyramus and Thisbe story (4608ffm)

The notior! that love gives courage and strength is a common-
place.¹

The suicide‚matif οἱ the Pyramus and Thisbe story was re-
peatedly used by Crestien as we have noted several times in the
course οἱ this study. It is very probable that the passage in Erec
was suggested to him by the Old French poem ot Pyrame et
Thisbe·

Professor Nitze’s cornparison οἱ Amores III, 3 ff. to a passage
in Erec where Enide’s eyes are described as glistening like stars,
while one could mirror oneself in her beauty, does not prove
Ovidian influence.⁸ Such descriptions are commonplace in the
literature οἱ the time.⁴ According to Faral, 'these descriptions were

¹ Fon-nd in Em, ⁹¹⁴ ff* and 5⁰56 ff. Professor Nitze (Mod. ΡΙκἹ..ΧῙ [1914],
449) has called mention ko the fact thu the conception οἱ the love of hdies as

a spur to valor already existed in Goeffrey of Monmonth's Historia regum Ι

Britanniae (ed, San Marte, Hane, 1854). The final sentence of lx, 13, reads u
follows: “Efficiebantur ergo astrue mulieres, et milites xmore illarum meliores*

*El-nider moi-ming the supposed death οἱ Erec. takes her hmbmd'x swerd
nnd intends to kill herself. This is the situation in the Pyramus story. There is
also an apostrophe οἱ death snmewhat similar to that in the Old Freneh Pyram
t! Thisbe:

Erec, 4656 Morz que demere et que atant,
Que ne me prant sans nul respit?

Par T„ 75⁴ Mon, que demores? Ωιτ me prens!

Por quoi demors? dest grant ton
Que ie ne sui or endroit murz.
