²⁴¹ The Romanic Review

however, is that Crestien listed his works in chronological order.
At least we may say that the argument based on the rhyme is οἱ no
importance. Meyer-Lubke¹⁰ rejects this argument and suggests
different linos in proof of his claim that Crestim was not forced to
list his works in a certain order on account of the rhyrne. Meyer-
Ltibke's lines do not follow the order that Paris considered the
actual chronological order in which Crestien wrote then-1. For that
reason six lines are here suggested as possible Old French lines
that may serve to show that the poet was not obliged to follow any
set order iu enumerating his early works but could have given them
in the order supposed by Paris to be chronological:

Cil qni de Philomena fist,

Et l’Art d'Amors an romanz mist,
Les regles d'Ovide rima,

Le Mors de l'Espaule σοι-ιη,

Et del roi Marc et d'Iseut dist,
Et d’Eree et d'Enide fist

De Boer takes up this question in the introduction to his edition
oi Philomena. On page cix he declares that we have the right to
conclude that Philomm is the “premiere en date des oeuvres con-
nues de Chretien de Troyes'' for the following reasons:

1. Use οἱ “el ⁷* for ‘¹ ele ¹* rather frequently. This form occtrrs
only two or three times in the great romances οἱ Crestien.¹¹ This
argument by itself 'proves nothing. Crestien might have used the
form at any point in his career. 15 we found it used frequently in
two or three poems and not at all in the rest then we might be
justified in making a division of his works on this ground.

2. A tendency to give long descriptions, whereas in his later
works Crestien oontented himself with giving short'indieations.
De Boer cites two such cases: the long description of Philomena¹s
moral persentiens and the description of the supper (172 ff. and
582 ff). As ior the first oi these descriptions we have found (See-
tion B, above) that it was borrowed from Ovid's Ars amatoria.
This fact establishes a strong probability that Crestien had already
