23 1 The Roman-'c Rem‘ew

ceval and the insomnia οἱ the lady. The author explains that Per-
eeval's hostess lies thinking becauseshe is deienseless against “une
bataille qui l'assaut” (1925). The wording οἱ the text brings to
our minds the love-warlare first because Clamadex and his attack
are not mentioned until several lines later (1965 ἓως and the play
on the words &ataine and assant is evident.

Until now, in the middle οἱ the night, this seli-possessed lady
has played the tole οἱ courteous hostess whose attentioris to the
comfort of her guest are not disturbed by any anxiety. She has
perfect control οἱ herself the next morning also-on the very day
when she leurs that Clamadex may get her into his power (2056111).

,This is the moment when we should expect her to tremble, sigh,
and weep from sear. But it is evident that the only really uneon-
trollable sear that causes her to tremble and weep is love-sear. If
she had wished only to induce Perceval to defend her, she would
have asked him publicly to do so, or at lust during waking hours.

Moreover, the earlier suggestion (183811.) that the two future
lovers were made for ench other:

1848 Que l¹un e l’autre semble

(Potvin, Qut dex l'un pur l'xutre ἰείη,
3064) Por oe qu'ensetnble les meist;

the fact that the lady passed the rest of the night in Perceval’s bech
also that Perceval asks and obtains her love the next morning
(2079 ff.)—all indicates clearly that this is a love episnde from the
beginning. Pereeval is so silent and baekward that the lady must
make the advances.

In Perceval love is personified as a god. The metaphors ol love
as a disease and as warfare occur. Lastly, Ovid's theory that all
women can be wnn and that they mean ¹⁴ yos ¹¹ when they say ‘⁴ no ”
is horrowed.

The passages that show influente from Ovid are as follows:
¹92³-42‚ 3817-38. 4164. 4¹73-4417.⁷⁴ 4823-6‚ 8912-23-

⁷⁴ Thi: ix the passage that deal: with Percevnl's absorption in thoughts οἱ his
mistress, brought on by the sight os blood clu-ops tm snow. The idea of the blood
draps seem: tu have come mn oi Celtic liternum (see Heinrich Zimmer,1ceuisch1

Studien, Banu, 1884, 11, που ἦ) and the development οἱ the mian is ctestien’s
own invention.
