The Influence of Ovid on Cresn'en de Troyes 113

Lancelot

Throughout Crestien’s Lancelot there runs a theme οἱ extreme
tyranny οἱ love, imperious and humiliating treatment by the loved
lady, and abject obedience on the part of the lover. Such a con-
ception οὶ love is distinctly Ovidian,¹¹ This matter will be dis-
cussed under the head of the' nature and effects of love in Ovid and
Cresn‘en. The theme in question is developed by a series of epi-
sodes which, though mostly οἱ Crestien's own invention, may be
due to Ovidiain suggestion. Such are (1) the incident of the cart
(323 ff), (2) lancelot's obediente in ceasing to attack Meleaganz
at a word from Guenievre (3806 ᾗ), (3) Guenievre's refusal to
greet Laneelot, her rescuer (3955 ff), (4) The toumament in
which Lancelot plays the toward at the conunand οἱ the Queen

The third of these incidents is undoubtedly οἱ direct Ovidian
inspiration. The Queen leaves Lancelot without speaking to him
and passes into another roorn thus shutting herself off from her

' lover in the manner so frequently recommended by Ovid.¹²

The fourth is probably an adaptation of the Three Days Toum-
ament—a widely diffused tale—<but it is used by Crestien to serve a
purpose suggested by his Ovidian theme.n

There >are several episodes or incidents in this romance that
illustrate other effects οἱ love than that of slavish obedience. Those
that are to be considered as due to the influence οἱ Ovid are such
as tend to exempliiy traits of that poet's conception of love. The
incideuts will be listed with an indication οἱ the trait that Crestien
is treating.
