²³9 The Romanic Rem'ew

Crestien has made this classica! tho-ne his own and has put iar
more into it than anyone before or since. It is his keen insight
into the psychological possibilities οἱ the situation and his elever
conception and analysis of a probable development οἱ such an inci-
dent in the life of a man and a woman that makes the poem still
readable and interesting. In fact, it would be difficult to find a love
theme devoid οἱ the added clement οἱ faithlessness developed in a
manner of equal psychological interest. As a psychological trent—
ment of an intimate sex relationship between two individuals Em
seems to be unique. Is there anywhere else an equally satisfying
and interesting drama of married lite into which the situation οἱ
the triangle does not enter?

Though the love-situation in Erec may be paralleled in Vergil
and other Latin writers¹⁸ there is little in Ovid that resembles it.
The theme οἱ uxoriousness occurs in the works of Ovid. Pm—
fessor Ogle has cited the passages.¹' Ovid's attitude toward the
theme is, however, the opposite of Crostien's in Erec. The atti-
tude οἱ the latin poet is expressed in the following lines from the
Amores:

Ι, 9, 31 Ergo desidiam quicumque vocabat amorem,
Desinat: ingeniist experientis amor.
Ardet in abducta Briseide magnus Achilles:

Ipse, ego segnis eram discinctaque in otia natus:
Mollierant animos lectus et umbra rneos;

Inpulit ignavum fornwsae cura puellae
Iussit et in castris aera merere suis:

Inde vides agilem nocturnaque bella gerentem.
Qui nolet fieri desidiosus, amet!

Since Erec is free from Ovidian influence on its love conoep-

¹ tion and C ligas, as we have already seen in our study οἱ this quos-
tion, is in places nothing but a patchwork οἱ fragments taken from
Ovid’s works and since this influence οἱ Ovid on the love concep-
tion οἱ Crestien's poenis continues through all οἱ the later works
including Parce-mxl, it is not possible to believe that Crestien had
