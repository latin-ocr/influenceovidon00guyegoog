The Influence of Om'd on σηπίαι de Troyes 23²

The lyrics resemble those of Provence and thereby present a
similar conception of love to that of Crestien¹s romanens. Some
direct influente from Ovid has been shown.

The following remarks deal with the relative chronology of
Crestien‘s early woriss ond seek to prove that Crestien listed these
worlss, with the exception of Guillaume d'Anytetme, in chronolog-
ioel order in his prologue to eliges. The convincing feature in the
evidence for our contentiori is the fact that the love-conception in
all of Crestien’s works except Erec et Enide and Gufflaume d'Anyle-
terre shows Ovidian influenee whereas in these two poems it is free
from such influence.

Amlyzing the relations of the lovers in Erec, we find that the
hero, who is a young and vigorous knight, meets Enide, a young
lady so beautiful that the whole court of King Arthur, without ι
dissenting voice, declares her to be more beautiful than any that
were there before her arrival. Enide is to serve Erec as his lady in
a combat with another knight Erec promises to marry Enide!
whom he hu found in rags. That he loves her deorly is very clar.
He obtains his bride, however, in the most matter of fact way.
There is no truce of th‘e sort of love that we have found in Philo-
mena, Cliyes, and the later romances. Erec has no hesitation, but

without fear and in the most straightforward manner asks the ⁴X

vavassor to give him his daughter in marriage:

660 Et vostre fille me bailliez
Demain a l'espervier conquerre,
Que je l'an manrai an rna terre,
Se Deus ln victoire me done:

None of the symptoms of love appear such as trembling. sighing, ᾖ
or fainting. There is no personifieation of love as a god; no rnen- ,
tion of love-sickness.

696 Erec dormi po cele nuit

cannot be taken as meaning that lu's love for Enide kept him awake.
The context preceding and following the line explains its meaning:

*691 Mout orent cele nuit vellie:
