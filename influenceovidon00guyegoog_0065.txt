The Influence of Ovid on Cres-rien de Troyes ²34

developed iu the schools and were much alike, being based, with
, more or less amplification, on set models.

The only classica! influences that appear at all dearly in the
love situation of Erec are found in connection with the moh'f οἱ
uxoriousness, which may be derived from Vergil.¹

Erec is preeminently a psychological novel. The main theme
oi the poem treats of a bmve young knight who has izllm into
uxoriousness and of the effect of this situation on both the man and
the woman. The inimitable knight appears no more in the lists⁴
His former eompanions in arms murmur and gossip over the
slothfulness of Erec until some remarks are reported to Enide.
Her pride, both for herself and for her husband, is hun by the
slander that has corne to her ears. She is unable longer to keep her
dissatisiaction and grief to herself. leizing the difficulty of the
situation, she does not wish to anger Erec by reproaches and yet
she wishes to induce him to regain his good reputatiorn For this
reason she husitates and appears to show a lack of §mmm-53⁶ toward
her husband. Erec is quite noturally disturbed by her embarrass-
ment and, no doubt, has heard and guessed enough to realize that
his wife is dissatisfied with him. He does not seem to be at all
jealous,⁷ but he is in doubt about Enide’s love for him. He knows
that she is blameless from the point oi view of her honor. Although
he is not jealous, yet he is not sure that she loves him and respects
him as much as he requires—ii she had not proved herself ready to
endure every hardship and to serve him and love him wholly aocord-
ing to his idea] οἱ woman's love for man, Erec would never have
returned home alive.⁸
