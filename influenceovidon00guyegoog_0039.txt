Ovm's Iurmcncr: on Crursrmu's Srvuz

The tweltth century was -a period of renewecl interest in the
Latin classies in Franoe. Crestien copied the Latin Classics much
as the Pleiade did in the sixteenth century, taking their litet-ary
figures and making thern his own in an attempt to develop a richer
style, It was on the works of Ovid in particular that Crestien
modeled his rhetorical style, copying the Latin poet's dramatie love-
monologue and pilfering literary figures. Crestien's lovers, except
in Erec and in Guillaume d'Anqleterre, speak in Ovidian ten-ns⁴ In
Philome-ha, Cliqbs and the later romances, love is treated in a highly

· rhetorical manner.

Ovid's Heroides, though written in the form ot letters, are
really psychological analyses of the various lovers’ states οἱ mind.
