'1 28 The Romancc Review

They are, in fact, nothing more nor less than love-monologues in
which the supposed writer οἱ each letter reveals his inmost thoughts
and ieelings. Through the Metamorphoses are seattered a number
οἱ Ιιτινενῐῃοηοίοὲιιεθ2 in which the speaker gives a natural and com-
plete exposure of the various, disconnected, incoherent thoughts
that pass through his mind at a moment of strong emotional excite>
ment. The speaker addresses numerous questions to himself and
gives wavering answers which reveal the mental struggle or uncer-
tainty to vwhich the person is subjected. These monologues are pre-
ceded or followed by comments on the part οἱ the author so that
they appear like little psychological dramas introduced by an
author’s prologue and followed by his comments.

Crestien has copied exactly this method of procedure as is most
clearly evidenced by the comparison that we have made. above, of
Medea's monologue (Met. V11, 11 ff.) to that os Soredamors
(Cliqes, 879 ἦ). Both poets show an equal interest in the psychol<
ogy of human actions; and they are both elever in analyzing and
explaining the motives that underlie the behavior of their charac-
ters* The mediaeval poet has put a more strictly logical order into
the thoughts of his characters, thinking thereby, no doubt, to im<
prove on his model. Such monologues are found in Cliqes (475-
523, 626-872, 897-1046. 4410-4574)‚L12nce101 (4215-42627 4³³6-
4414), and Yvain (1428-1506‚ 1760-1772, 3531—62).

We have already shown that Crestien copied Ovid’s personifica-
tion oi love as a g0d; and we have noted the French poet's use of
the Ovidian metaphors of love as a fire, as a science. as warfare,
and as a disease in our discussion oi the nature and effects of love
in the works of Ovid and of Cresn‘en. The language cannot be
separated from the eonception- Therefore Crestien, in adopting
Ovid's treatment οἱ love necessarily imitated the Latin poet's style.

Additional figures borrowcd from Ovid by Crestien in Cliqes
are the metaphor of the strong roots of love:

Qu'il ne peut estre mecinez
