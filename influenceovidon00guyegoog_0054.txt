Soredamors is determined to control her eyes, which hold power
over her beart. If her will is strong enough she ean turn her eyes
away and she would hold herself in slight esteem if she were not
able to do so. Ovid says: “it is only what you see that troubles
you, Narcissus. You have but to turn away and you will be cured.’'

Now in Alixandre’s monologue the same question is taken up
and expanded in the same logical 1ashion. Allegorizing the whole
matter, Soredamors, the sight οἱ whom has inflamed our hero with
love, becomes in Crestien's language an arrow, or better still her
image becomes an arrow thus wounding Alixandre's heart through
his eyes. Thus in his case, as in that of Soredamors his hem and
his eyes turn traitors toward hirn. He says that liis own eyes kill -,
him (759). Ovid says of Narcissus:

Met. 1111440 Perque oculos perit ipse suos.
