²¹9 The Romam'c Κινέην

It is quite possible, as Professor 'Lowes has suggested, that Cres-
rien and oti-ier poets of the Middle Aga may have been acquainted
with medical treatises on this disense. If they were¹ the fact might
explain the sources οἱ the symptoms οἱ sweating and yawning that
are found in the French romances but not in Ovid.³⁰ The principa!
source of inspiration ior this conception, however, is literary.

It is probable, on account of the accumulation of evidence point-
ing toward Crestien's intimate and extmsive knowledge of Ovidv
that our poet went directly to the latin writer ior most οἱ his
material on love. Ovid was always his justiiying authority in this
sciente. To be sure Ovid had been lmown to the poets of Provence
and both his conception οἱ love and his literary traeunent οἱ the
subject had been copied and adopted by them for over a century³¹
when Crestien became interested in this type oi love-treatment.
Many ot Ovid's stories were well known by scholars and were un-
don‘htedly told frequently in public. Latin works οἱ the time imitat-
ing Ovid, such as the Roman'ct’monn's Concilium³⁸ and the Alter-
catio de Phyllide et Floru,⁶⁸ may have preceded Crestien's works.
The date οἱ these Latin poems is, however, undetermined as yet-
The same commonplaces of language and attitude are to be found
ς in other French writings of the epoch such as Encas and the poems

of Gautier d’Arras. For these reasons it is necessary to suppose
that rnuch o( what we find in Crestien's treatment οἱ love was cur-
rent at the time. To how great an extent such was the case, it is
difficult to determine, The problem extends beyond the limits οἱ
