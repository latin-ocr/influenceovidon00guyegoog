The Influencc of Otia W Crestien de Troves ¹29

654 Des que primes cest mal santi,
¹ Se mtrer l’osasse ne dire,
Poisse je parler a mire,
Qui del tot me poist eidier:

This metaphor is taken from the Remedia amoris. The corn-
mand is

91 Principiis obstat:

for love like a tree quickly sends out strong roots. When it was
young it could easily have been pulled up. Crestien has this same
idea (654 ffss). But soon the roots have grown too deep:

Remedia, 87 Nune stat in inmensum viribus acta suis.
106 Et mala radices altius arbor agit?

The metaphor οἱ the lover stoi-ming a castle (Cliqbs, 33673) has
already been shown to be a bon-owing from Amores 11. 12, 7-85‘

Two Ovidian similes appear in Cliqks* The first is the com-
parison of secret love to fire under ashes (Cliqbs, 604ss and Met⁴
IV, 63-4).²³ The second is the comparison of the lover ιο εῃῑοκ
(eliges, 1033 and Amores Ι, 2, ¹3*14)›²⁸

Lanceloi contains two Ovidian metaphors other than those that
have to do with the nature or effect of love. The first is the figure
of sailing and arriving in port. This figure is mingled with that of
love as a disease that is enred by the presence οἱ the loved lady*
Ovid is very fond of both of these figures and. though Crestien has
used them in an original manner, yet we find the two figures of
arriving in port and of curing the love-sickness combined by Ovid
also at the end of the Remedia amoris. Both pzssages follow:

Lancelot, 1582 ¹¹ Mout ai or bien et droit nagie
Qu’a mout buen port sui arivez.
Or sui je toz descheitiez:

⁸¹ This metaphor had already been used in Philammon
