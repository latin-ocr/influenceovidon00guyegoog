221 The Romam'c Review

Like the Tn'sean, C liqbs has an enfances dealing with the love story'
οἱ the hero’s parents and a second part which tells of the hero's
love for the wife οἱ his uncle. In the first part of Clists, the
treachery οἱ Angres and Arthur’ s campaign against him have been
shown by Miss Hopkins³⁰ to be modeled on Wace's Brut or at last
on the Historia reyum Britanniae οἱ Geoffrey οἱ Monmouth.

This general structure has been so motivated as to admit an

extensive lovetreatment based on Ovid in each part. To the brav- .

ery of the knight, to 'his loyalty toward his overlord, and to his

adaptation of those elernents to his own needs.

in the situation and relationship of Fenice and Thessala strikingly
