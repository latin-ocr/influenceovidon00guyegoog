THE INFLUENCE OF OVID ΟΝ CRESTIEN DE T ROYES

HE purpose of this study is to set forth, in the briefest manner
possible, the influence of Ovid on Crestien de Troyes.¹ This
influente appears particularly in the love-treatment in all the works
of Crestien that have come down to us with the 33an ot Erec
et Enide and Guillaume a‘Anyletma There is still some doubt as
to whether our Crestien wrote the last named poem. Leaving the
Guillaume, therefore, out οἱ consideration for the moment, it may
be said that the influence of Ovid on Crestien’s conception ot love
marks a elearcut division in our author's literary development.
Thus the chronological order οἱ Crestien's work will, ineidentally,
be established as that in which the poet listed them himself in his
Εἷς-ΚΒΜ to C liqbs, with the Ovidium, which mark the beginning of
the French poet’s infatuation with Ovid, followingrEn’c. The tale
of Guillaume d'Angjlete-rre presents especial difficulties bemuse its
love-situations resemble Crestien's earlier manner and yet the work
is not mentioned in the prologue to Cliyes. It will appear, how-
ever, in the course of our study that the poem in question was
written either by another than Crestien de Troyes or, if by our
poet, then early in his career before he adopted the Ovidian love-
psychology. ’

It is remarkable that so attractive a theme has never received
careful and adequate attention. As early as 1883 Gaston Paris
called attention to the fact that the idea of treating love as a sciencet
must have had its origin in Ovid's Ars amatoria, and thus indicated ‘1
