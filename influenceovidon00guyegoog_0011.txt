The Influence of Ovid um Crestien de Troyes 99

linos of cliqes where the poet givos a list of several, though per-
haps riot all οἱ his earlier works:

Cil qui fist d’ Erec et d’ Euide,

Et les Comandemanz Ovide

Et l'Art d’Arnors an ron-lanz mist

Et de la Hupe et de l'Aronde

Et del Rossignol la Muance,
Les Comandemana Ovide et 1¹Art d’Amors tnay be the title of a
single work or two works οἱ Crestien may be implied This work
may be a translation οι· adaptation' m French οἱ one Ovidian poem ’
In that case Crestien refers obviously to the Ars amatoria. The
F renel-1 poet may have translated two works of Ovid, and he may
mean by the Comandemanss ovida Ovids Remedia amoris The
latter interpretation seems the more probable on account οἱ the ex>
tensive use that our poet has made οἱ the Remedia amoris as winf,
appear from the evidence to be presented below, De 10 Hupe et de
1¹Amnde et del Rossiynol la Muance is clearly a translation or adap-
tation oi Ovid's tale of Philomela in the Metamorphoses (VI,
426 ἦ).

Ι11 Cliqes {our Ovidian characters are mentioned ; Narcissus.

Medea, Helen and Paris* Medea's native country Thessaly is also

mentioned. The ‘story of Narcissus (Met. ΙΙΙ, 339 ff.) is briefly
related (2766 ff.) and Cliges is compared to that Ovidian character.

, Thessala, Fenice’s nurse, is said to know more οἱ witehcraft and en-

ehamments than Medea (303oe see Metamorphoses VII. 10 ff.)
Thessala was born in Thessaly (3006). The probability that the
influente at this point comes {rom ovid is increased by the fact that
one of Soredamor’s monologues (897 ff.) appears to be modeled
directly on that of Medea (Met. VII. 10 ff). Cligesy proposal to
take Fenice to his unele's land may easily have been suggested to
Crestien by that of Paris to Helen in Ovid’s Epistolae (XV,
175 ἦ). Paris tells οἱ the extent of his iather's realm and of the
crowds that will welcome Helen in the magnificent city οἱ Troy ;
and eliges says:

5299 Qu’onques ne {u a si grant joie,
Elainne receiie a Troie
