ι 26 The Romanic Review

Guenievre shut her door against Lancelot (3985). The other humil-
iations to which Lmeelot is subjected are inventions of Crestien or
of Marie. It was necessary to find new ways οἱ developing this
theme because the particular methods of Ovid were not suitable ior
a romanee οἱ the twelfth century.

Evidence οἱ this conception in the works os Ovid is abundant.
In the Ars amatoria, one of the works οἱ Ovid that Crestien trans-
lated, this theme is developed by precept and example. Patience is
recommended : ·

11, 177 Si nee blanda satis, nec erit tibi cornis amanti,
Perfer et obdural postmodo initis erit.

§Ovid teaches obedience to the will οἱ the loved lady; he cites
the ease oi Atalanta's emelty toward her lover, Milanion, and the
trials that he endured. The precepts of Ovid's art require the ob-
servanee of the following rules:

Ars ΙΙ, 197 Cede repugnanti: cedendo vietor abibis;
Fac modo, quas partis illa iubebit, agas!

The lover must not be ashamed to do anything for the sake oi love.
The cases οἱ Hercules and of Phoebus Apollo are cited as examples
οἱ extreme humiliation endured by lovers (Ars 11, 2ο9ἐ1“.),’1
