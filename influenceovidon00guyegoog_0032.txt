120 The Romam‘c Review

punishes them with great severity. This harshness is sometimes
treated as vengeance that Love takes on those who resist his will.
He is provided with arrows which wound the hearts of lovers.
Within his victims’ breasts he enkindles the fire οἱ love. On the
other hand, Iove inspires men with great com-age and inci-cases their
strength to a remarkable degree.

Ovid also considers love as a science or art that must be learned.
In the Ars amatoria Ovid poses as the teacher of love. At other
times love is a sort of warfare. Love is the leader and the lover is
a soldier* In Ovid's works love is also treated as a disease and Ovid
becomes the doctor of love in the Remedia armaris⁴

The love-sickness is distinguished from all other diseases by the
peculiarity of being both pleasant and painiul at the same time.
The effects or symptoms of Iove are paleness, trembling, sear, loss
of appetite, sighing, sleeplessness, weeping, crying out, iainting,
mental absorption often leading to insane action and causing loss
of the senses, insanity, and even death. The disease can be cured by
the lover; that is, by a retum of affection.

The evidence bearing on this division of our study will be ar>

. ranged according to the above analysis⁴ Only a small number οἱ

references to Ovid's works will be given, Then will follow details
from each οἱ Crestien's works except Erec and Guillaume d’Anqle-
terre⁴ In these two poems the author treats love in a manner free
{rom Ovidian influence.
Ovid
God of love, irresistible:

H erl IX, 25 Quem non mille ferae, quem non Stheneleius hostis,
Non potuit Iuno vincere, vincit Amor.

M et. V, 369 Tu superos ipsumque loven-n, tu numina ponti
Victa domas ipsumque, regit qui numina ponti.

The power of Love appears in Amores Ι, 2.
Love tortures:

Amores 1,1,25 Me miserum! certas habuit puer ille sagittas:
Uror, et in vacuo pectore regnat Amor.
