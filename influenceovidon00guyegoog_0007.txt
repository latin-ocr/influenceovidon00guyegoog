The work has been done at the suggestion and under the directim
οἱ Professor W. A. Nitze, to whom I am greatly indebted for as-
sistance and criticism. My interest in the French language and liter-

fessors L. H. Dow and P. O⁴ Skinner at Dartmouth College and later
developed hy scholarly inspiration from Proiessors W. Ar Nitze, T.
Α, Jenkins, Karl Pietsch, E. ΡΔ Dargam Ε. H wilkins, and T. P⁴
Cross. They have offered many helpfu] suggestions. Thanks are
also rendered to Professor S. G, Paeterson for friendly interest and
the loun of books from his persona] library, and to Prostssor Ray-
mond Weeks for various kind offices'.
