The Influence of Ovia on Creseien de Troyes ¹25

Cui-ing the love-sickness: 634-600 (Alixandre refers to Soredamors
as the one who could eure him. This manner of expression has
already been noted for Ovid), 3093, 3137, 4351, 438ffi6, 5071,
5092 ff„ 5707 ff, 6255*-

Crestien has added two symptoms of love-siekness not to be

found in Ovid ς namely, sweating (462) and yawning (885).

Lancelot

Love personified as an irresistible god: 376 ff., 1245 ff., 1348 ff.

Torture: 1349, 4392. The power and tyranny of Love is usually
transferred, in this romance, to the lady; she tries and humiliates the
loven-7 exacting and obtaining implicit obediente: 3816 ff„ 3955 ff„
4501, 5656 ff. Crestien's use of this clement os the Ovidian iove-
treatment is very important, for it gives the peculial· tone of Cres-
tien*s version οἱ the Lancelot story. Although Marie de champagne
and the Provencal poets may have been responsible for the thenoe
οἱ {rank adultery in Lancelot and though the elevation of the mis-
tress far above the humble lover is characteristic οἱ Provenqal
poeti-y, yet it is clear from Fi Li Mott¹s thorough study οἱ Ρτονεηςεὶ
lyrics¹⁰ that the litei-ary theories οἱ the South of France previous to
Ciestien furnish insufficient material to serve as the source οἱ
Crestien’s conception of love in this romance. Not only is the lady
exalted far above the lover but she is also an imperious and tyran-
nical mistress and the slavishly obedient lover is subjected to harsh
treatment and humiliating commands. The Provenoal lover was
not reduced to such ignominious slavery.²⁰ Although the lover
eomplained in Provenqal lyrics of the cruelty of his mistress, this
cruelty was only the withholding of her love and previous to Cres-
tien we do not find cases of actual tormenting of the lover by his
mistress in the poems of the troubadours nor do we find humilia-
tions being inflicted upon the lover by his mistress According to
Ovid, however, who is the only model for such a love conception
previous to Crestien and accessible to him, the lover must be ready
to endure the most shameful humiliations and gladly make himself
the slave of his mistress. In imitation of Ovid our author has
