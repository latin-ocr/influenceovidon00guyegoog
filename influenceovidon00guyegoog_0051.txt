The Influence of Ovt'd on Crestien de Troyes 220

this essay. Before the solution of the question is possible it will be
necessary to establish a much surer chronology οἱ the works οἱ the
period both in Latin and in French. We know, however, that
Crestien went far beyond the Provenqal lyrie poets in developing a
system οἱ courtly love-⁵¹ We know that he was the most important
single writer to aid in the establishment οἱ the literary vogue οἱ
courtly love. Provenqal literature. as well as the interest that court·
ladies such as Eleanor οἱ Poitou and Marie of Champagne took in
pricieussr discussions of love questions and in love literature¹ must>
have been a great stimulus to Crestien. It is due to them, no doubt,
that Crestien turned his attention toward Ovidian love. Neverthe-
less, remembering that the interest ot the high society of the time in
questions oi love was due to a literary influence on that society and
realizing Crestien's intimate and extensive knowledge of 0vid, it is
saie to assume that in the matter ot love Crestien was an authori-
tative instructor of those circles for which he wrote. He was
clearly the great vulgariter οἱ Ovidian love doctrine.

The extent to which Celtic material enters into these romances
has not been determinet] and we are, here, in no way concerned
with that question. Ovid did not fumish the plots οἱ Crestien’s
romances. Whether some οἱ his plots were original or what their
source may have been, it is not nur duty to determine. It would
seem probable, however, that at some points Crestien effeetcd an
amalgamation ot Celtic and Classical elements.

The source of C lists is known* There can be little doubt after
the studies of Gaston Paris⁶⁶ and Foerster⁵⁹ that all the material
that Crestien could have had in the conte on which he states that he
based his main plot is 'contained in a very short tale of M arques de
Rome,⁶⁷ although that version ot the tale is itself ot the 13th een-
tury. Foerster has shown by demiled analysis that the tale in
M unques de Rome could not have been taken from C liges but rnust
have been based on Crestien's source.

Starting with this tale, Crestien worked out the first poem to
which he gave the name of roman⁵⁸ as a “Ti-istan reneuvelefffl·
