The Influence of Ovili tm Crestien de Troycs 1393

5160 Et bien sachiez, ne li fu mie
Li huis a l’ancnntre termez.

In Ovid the lady’s door is often closed against her lover* ‘Ovid
even rqqornmends this procedure to ladiesfl’

“ In Lancelot Crestien has used a device, similar to the one noted
in Cliqes, to heighten the interest οἱ his narrative by suggesting
something unconventional that is left untold. This method οἱ in-
troducing a racy touch was probably suggested to Crestien by his
reading in Ovid,

Lancelot, 4695 Une joie et une mervoiile
Tel qu’onques ancer sa paroille
Nc fu oie ne seiie3
Mes toz iorz iert par moi teiie,
Qu’an conte ne doit estre dite.
Des joies (u la plus eslite
Et la plus delitable cele
Que li contes nos test et cele⁴

In descrihing a similar circumstance Ovid said in the Ars
amatoria:

ΙΙ, 793 Conscius, ecce, duos accepit iectus amantes:
Ad thaiarni clausas, Musa, resiste fores!³¹

At the end of a similar description in an elegy to the beauties of
Corinna we read:

Amores 1, 5, 25 Cetera quis nescit? lassi requievimus ambo⁴
Proveniant medii sic mihi saepe dies!

And in the Ε pistles between Hero and Leander:

XVII, 105 Cetera nox et nos et turris conscia novit
' Quodque mihi iumen per vada monstrat iter:

δ” Cf. Ars 111, 70. 580 ff,; Amores Ῑ, ἃ I, 9, 8; ΙΙΙ, 8. 6, etc.

¹¹ There follows a description οἱ a portion οἱ the joy ot the lovers, never-
theiess; and though the description is quite differem from that in Crestien's
Lanceloe (4669 ff). or from that in Erec (2071 ff), there is a possibility that the
idea of treat‘ng such a situation, or the justificatior· {or so doing, may have been
suggested by this passage in the Ars amatoria οι· by other, or Ovid (οςΔ Amores
