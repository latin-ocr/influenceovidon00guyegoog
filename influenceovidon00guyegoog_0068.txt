²37 The Romum'c Review

The author says for himself:

2584 Or est Enide an grant esfroi:
Mout se lieve triste et pansive,
A li sole rauce et estrive
De Ia solie qu'ele dist;
‘rant grate chievre que mal gistt

Later, un account of her contrition:

3100 anues la nuit ne sornella,
Ainz tint par les ἰτείης an sa main
Les ehevaus jusqu'a l’andemain,
Et rnout s'est blasmee et maudite
De la parole qu'ele ot dite,

‘⁴ Lassel¹¹ fet ele, “con mar vi
Mon orguel et ma sorcuidaneel

In fact, Enide has slandered her husband and she has allowed her
pride to lead her to express disapproval of her husband’s conduct,
rhus showing disrespect but also apparent disloyalty toward Erec
because she seems to side with his detractors. Moreover, she is
guilty οἱ one of the seven dezdly sins; nasnely, pride.

Erec's troen'nfflt of his wife is not surprising. It is natural.
If his treatment of Enide had not been stem and reproving we
would need to explain it. The reason that this perfectly natural
conduct of Erec has puzzled scholars is, without doubt, the fact
that they have looked upon this romanoe in the light of Crestien's
love-treatment in the later romances. The truth οἱ this statement
is borne out by Foerster's use οἱ the term minnediense¹² or the cita-
tion of Guinizelli's ¹¹ Al cor gentil ripara sempre Amore.'¹¹¹ The
use οἱ the term “111ἰ1111εάἰε115ι” is, to say the least, highly mislead-
ing and the comparison of the love-treatment in Erec to that of
Guinizelli is entirely out os place. Crestien was never “touched
with mysticism '’ nor is he at this time the poet of courtly love. In
order to understand Erec it is necessary to realize that Crestien has
not yet developed that new, artificial attitude toward love through
the study of Ovid and the influenees from the South.
