ι 16 The Romanic Review

Y vain
1

Yvain first sees Laudine at the funeral of her dead husband;
he is so deeply impressed by her beauty in the midst οἱ her maurn-
ing that he immediately falls in love with her⁴

1406 Quant an ot anfoi le mort,
S'an partirent totes les janz
Clers ne chevaliers ne serianz
Ne dame n'i remest que cele,
Qui sa dolor mie ne cele.

The grief οἱ Laudine is described at length and her beautiful hair
and her weeping are dwelt upon⁴ This episode was clearly sug-
gested to Crestien by the following lines of the Ars amatoria which
Crestien himself tells us he turned into French (C lsyes, 3) ἶ

ΙΙΙ, 431 Funere saepe viri vir quaeritur: ipse solitis
Crinibus et fletus non tenuisse decet.

The winning οἱ Laudine’s love is doubtless elaborated from
Ovid's advice to seek the aid of a serving girl enjoying the full con-
fidente οἱ the lady:

Ars Ι, 351 Sed prius ancillam captandae nosse puellae
Cura sit ancessus molliet illa tuos.
Proxima consiliis dominae sit ut illa, videto,
Neve parum tacitis conscia fida iocis;

Quod petis, ei( facili, si'volet' inasferes.
Illa leget tempus (medici quoque tempora servant),
Quo facilis dominae mens sit et apta. capi.

Crestien has known how to follow these directions to the letter.
Yvain's suit would have been hopeless without Lunete; with her
help Laudine was quickly won. Lunete had the entire confidente
of her mistress; and she knew how to choose the proper moment for
each move (1589 ff).
