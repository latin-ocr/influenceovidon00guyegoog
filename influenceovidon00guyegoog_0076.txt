works following these translations.²⁸ It is also clear that Philumena
probably followed the translation οἱ the Ars amorio because the
love treatment as well as certain speeiflc borrowings in Philomena
show an unusual interest in the Ars amatoria, which interest is best
explained by supposing that the Ovidian work that Crestien lists
first in cuqes was the first ehronologically. Thus we have shown
the probability that four oi the early works οἱ Crestien were writ-
ten in the order in which he himself listed them; narner Erec, Art
cl'Amors, Philomena, cliyes. It is probable that all were chrono-
logically given that appear in the Guges list.

’ Having established this division οἱ Crestien’s works on the
basis of the influenee of Ovid on the love-treatment, it is a simple
matter to assign other works that may at any time be attributed
to our author to the earlier or the later period οἱ his literary career.
Ι( Maurice Wilmotte¹s recent arguments for the authenticity of
Guillaume d'Anyletend' are finally to convince the scholarly world
that Crestien de Troyes wrote this poem it will be necessary to group
it with Erec because the love-treatment in the Guillaume is not that
of the later period. Nowhere in the series from the translation oi
the Ars amatoria on to the end οἱ his life is there a place {or such
a poem as the Guillaume d'Anyleterre. Although the work is not
mentioned in the prologue to Cqu-r, it is necessary to date it earlier
or to discard it from the works oi our author. Paris is unquestion-
ably right in pointing out the ineongruity of this work among those
οἱ Crestien aiter Cliybslw Crestien may have failed to mention

¹³ n may be added that scholars have generally considered Em as a very
early work (οἱΔ Suchier’s Histm of Old French Lieemture, 143). The presence
of assonanoe has been noted in contras( to the merul trun-nent οἱ rhyme in the
other romanas, Long lists of names occur in Erec, while lists of such length
were later avoided by Crestien, ln Erec he mentions the chamum* dc gesur—a
thing that, according to Suchier, scarcely occurs in lzter Arthurinn romances.
At the end of the first division οἱ Em, Crestien uses ι formula common in
the epic:

1844 Ci fine li premerains vers.

F⁴ M. Warren was inclined, from his study of the nyie in Crestien's woxks
(Mod Phil„ lv [1906-7l, 670), to consider Em an urly work of our author.
