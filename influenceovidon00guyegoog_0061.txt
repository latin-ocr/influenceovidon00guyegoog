a crane, οἱ love compared to a horse that may be spurred on υι
reined in, of Gauvain comparedao the sun, and οἱ late-coming love
compared to a green log.

There are three love-monologues; two by Yvain (142813. and
3531 ff.) and one by Laudine (1760ffi).

Borrowings from Ovid have been noted in the following lines:
14-17, 880-91, 1356-74, 1398-1402, 1920. 1959-63, 1875-2020,

Perceval or the Contes del Graal appears to have a strong didac- ’
tic purpose. The main interest is in the education and training of
a knight. This training and the quest motis are the essential themes
of the poem and they turn the development οἱ the romance defi-
nitely away from love. Perceval gives up worldly comforts and
joys for a greater purpose-'¹⁸ Nevertheless a small amount of
Ovidian influence is to be found in this romanoe.

There is only one short love episode in this poem; namely that
of the castle besieged hy Clamadex (Baist, 1911 ἧς Potvin.
3¹²7 ff). This episode is developed with great subtlety; for it is
combined with the motive of the lady’s distress over the threztened
attack οἱ Clamadex, who wishes to have the lady as his bride.
Moreover the psychological handling is clever; ior even when Per-
eeval's hostess has arisen from her bed to enter the room οἱ her
guest in the middle οἱ the night, she assures herself that it is only
in order to tell him ο( her trouble.

Perceval has retired for the night and fallen at once into a
sound sleep. for he knows nothing of the ''deduit de pueele”
(Baist: 1914-¹ 5) and thoughts οἱ love do not keep him awakel

cant. The render familiar with the love-treatment of Crestien and
other writers ot the time who described the assaults οἱ love upon
the wakeful lover, tossing and turning upon his bed, trembling, per-
spiring, sighing, and weeping will immediately be struck by the
suggestion implied in the contrast between the sound sleep οἱ Per-
