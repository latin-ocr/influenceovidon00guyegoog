The Influence uf Ovid on Crestien de Troyes 24⁶

several of his earlier works in Cliyes. Having turned to a new
manner, it is quite natural that he should have mentioned solely the
best one of the works of the earlier period which preceded the
influence oi Ovid on his lovepsyehology.

The love—treatment in Guillaume d'Anyletme contains none of
the characteristic Ovidian elernents ssiat occur in every love episode
or reference to love in Cliyes, Lancelot, Yvau'n, and Percewl.
There is abundant opportunity in this tale for the psychological
study of love and its effect on the characters of the story. The fact
that it belongs tu a group of stoi-ies known under the general
formula οἱ the Man Tried by Fare⁸¹ has nothing to do with this
question. The freedom with which Crestien transfor-med his mate-
rial to suit his own purposes is sufficiently clear from the incidenml
evidence that has come out in the present study to warrant the
statement that Crestien would have retold this story in his own way
and with his own interpretfflion⁴

The love οἱ the King and the Queen in this story is portrayed
as very great. The Queen makes every sacrifice in order to accom-
pany her husband in his wanderings and later resists every temp-
tation to become disloyal to him while they are separated. And
yet the separation (753 ffi), though accompanied by grief, does not
produce any such result as the separation o( Cliges and Fenice or οἱ
Yvain and Laudine. It is impossible to believe that Crestien would
not have introduced sume suggestion of mental absorption,⁵² mad—
ness, or a desire to commit suicide on the part οἰ the King or the
Queen ii he had written the Guillaume after C liqes.

“A similariry appears—ef, Wilmone (ορ. eit, 9-ru)—between the tranen
οἱ Guillaume (2596 ff.) at his wiie's table when he imagines that he is hunting
and the cases of mental absorption caused by love that occur in the romulee:-
In the roman-:es the heroes are suffering from love-siamus and they xre think-
ing οἱ their mistresses: Gufflaume’s ffionghen wander- away from his love οἱ the
Queen und he dreams while waking. There is complete absorption- οἱ the mind
in both uses and Crestien may have imi the consciousnesx of a connection be-
tween some or the situations that Wilmotte has brought together, but from a

literar-y point uf view there is a vast differente between the thought οἱ Guinanme
here and tint οἱ a man fiued with thoughts of iove.
