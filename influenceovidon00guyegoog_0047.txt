THE INFLUENCE OF OVID ΟΝ CRESTIEN DE TROYES

Coucmsmns

Eidem for an incident modeled on the suicide motis οἱ the
Pyramus and Thisbe story (4608 ff.),¹¹ there is no marked influence
of Ovid on Erec ee Em‘de. In Guillaume d’Anqtetme the descrip-
tion οἱ the storrn (²3⁰3) is copied from Ovid, but otherwise this
tale seems also m be free from Ovidian influence. Philomena, οἱ
course, is an adaptation οἱ Ovid's story οἱ Philomela⁴ We have
seen that Crestien amplified the description οἱ the heroine and also
the love—treatment in this story hy the help of suggestions from the
Ars amatoria and the Remedia amoris.

Qur main interest lies in ΕΙίρὲ-τ, Laudat, and Yvan'n. Whereas
in Erec Iove is treated rapidly and naturally, in these roi-nantes the
love-treatment becomes rhetorical. An entirely new psychology of
love is developed. And it will probably be admitted by all smrlmts
οἱ Crestien that the psychological analysis of love is the essential
clement οἱ these poerns. That analysis above all distinguishes them
and explains their widespread popularity and influence in the
Middle Ages.

12 cannot be too emphatic-any stated that Crestien was not pri-
mai-ily interested in the telling οἱ a popular talei His own words
are enough to convince us; for in Erec he expresses his scorn οἱ
those who mn earn their living by mere story telling.⁸⁸ His desire
is to use a tale of adventure in order to transferi-n it into
