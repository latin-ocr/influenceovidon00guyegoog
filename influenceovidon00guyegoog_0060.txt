²²9 The Ronumic Review

as Professor Brown states‚'¹¹ to be endnwed with remarkable artistic
calent in order to effect that transferi-tration.

In transforrning his source Crestien produces a love-intrigue
modeled directly on the recommendations of Ovid. This intrigue
was double: for after winning his lady’s love Yvain loses it ior a
time, thereby becoming insane from grief; and, after recovering
§rom his madness, wins his lady back again according to Ovidian
precepts. The romance as a whole presents a loose structure with a
number of episodes of interest in themselves but held together only
by the theme οἱ Yvain's love ior Laudine with its intrigues and the
suffering that it causes the lover. This love being of the Ovidian
type it is evident that the influente οἱ Ovid gives to this romance its
real character and chief interest.

Laudine shows some Ovidian elements in her make-up, particu-
larly as a harsh mistress who causes her lover much suffering. She
is also the Ovidian woman οἱ a thousands moods.⁷²

Lunete is the Ow'dian go-between as servant ot the lady, but is
raised by her loyalty to her mistress and to Yvain to a high moral
plane. Yvain by his obediente, patience, endurance of hardship.
and especially by his insanity due to love is conceived to a large
degree on the suggestions of Ovid.

It is the elements of insanity and οἱ winning a lady by the help
of a serving maid that are emphasized in Yvao'n, The physical
effects of love appear, but much less extensively than in Guges.

There are several episodes or incidents in va'n that are due to
Ovidian influence. These are the funeral of laudine's husband at
which Laudine attracts Yvain, her next husband; the first love-
intrigue3 Yvain's madness; the scene at the fountain based on the
Pyramus and Thisbe story; the buming of the evil counsellors; and
the second love-intrigue.

Love is personified as a god. Love is treated metaphorically as
a disease and as warfare. There is also the metaphor of love's deep
roots. Other figures of speech that are imitated from Ovid are the
five similes οἱ Yvain pursuing Esclados compared to a hawk after
