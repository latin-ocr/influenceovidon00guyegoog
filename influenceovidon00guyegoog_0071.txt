The Influence ¹?f Ovid on Cres-tien de Troyes- 240

already translated the chief source of this notion; namely, the Ars
amatoricu for it is unquestionably the work οἱ translation or adap-
tation that inspired erestien so thoroughly with this Ovidlan nian-
ner of (reating love that he never ceased to reveal its influfflce after
once hav-ing become iniatuated with it.

Philomena, the translation οἱ Ovid‘s Ars amatoria, and the
Pelops story, collectively designated by Foerster as the Ovidium,
have generally been considered as the earliest of Crestien’s work.
Gaston Paris puts Philumena first os all, then the translation οἱ the
Ars amatoria, and third the Pelops story or Mors de l'espaul'e.
Both Paris and Foerster place the Tristan or Del roi Marc et d'Iseu!
la blande next, then Erec, C liges, Lancetot, Yvain, and Percevat in
the order named except that Foerster places Guillaume d'Anyleterre
immediately aiter Ctiyes. Paris would also give the last named
work the same relative date ii one insists on attributing it to
Crestien.¹⁷

Our study of the love-troannent in Crestien's work has shown
that this order of our poet's works is incorrect, It is not the order
in which Crestien listed them himself in the prologue to cuyes:

Cil qui fist d'Erec et d'Enide,

Et les comandernanz Ovide

Et l’Art d‘Annors an romanz mist
Et le Mors de l'Espaule fist,

Del roi Marc et d'Iseut la blonde,
Et de la Hupe et de 1’Aronde

Et del Rossignol la Muance

This order was disturbed to fit the theory that Crestien began his
career as a poet with translations inspired by his study of the classics
during his school days.

The order in which Crestien arranged his works in the pro-
log-ue to Cliyes is, according to Paris,¹⁶ of no consequence, being
detennined by the exigeneies of the rhyme. Foerster is ο( the same
opinion,¹⁹ although he admits that the theory in regard to the rhyme
can be no more than a supposition. The more natural hypothesis,
