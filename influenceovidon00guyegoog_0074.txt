deals with the story of Ciigis himself. The correspondifig linet
from Philumena follow:

Mes de tot ce ne panse il (Pandion)

The rame which De Boer considers the name of Crestieu de Troyes
does not appar until we reach line 734 and yet the preoeding lium
have nothing of the dian-aeter οἱ a prologue or introductionT In
fact the two lines 733-4:

La meisons estoit an un bois,
—Ce eunte Crestiiens li Gois—

commonplace and ugly in the midst οἱ fine, smoothly flowing lines
are dearly out of place. They shoek the reader's ear and reval
their origin. They are from the pen of a commentator and not a
poet. It is evident that these two lines were inserted by the author
of the Ovide moralis-22¹³ He has told us so himself. Why doubt
his statement? The name of the author οἱ the Om‘de moralisb ap-
pears ou two manuscripts ot this huge poem and on another manu-
script, which contains only the table of the conten-its οἱ this poem
his name is given as Crestiens de Gowais de Sey-nt More vers Troy-s,
de 1¹0rdre des frere menours. In the other manuscripts his name
is given in the oblique case as Crestien Le Gouays de Saincte More
vers Troyes.¹⁸ The author os the Ovide maruli-eb tells us in the
epilogue to his poem that he is of this order of rnonks.'¹ There is
no evidence to prove that the annotations on the manuscripts are
incon-eet. lt is therefore probable that the annotators were well
informed. The Ovide moralis& was very popular in the time of
Eustache Deschamps, who mentions the author of the Ovide mom-
lira-⁵ among those who, according to him, have brought glory to
Champagne.⁸⁸ No doubt Deschamps possessed much information in
regard ιο this poem and its author that we lack to-day.”
