Lancelot

Lancelot is Crestien's closest imitation of an Ovidian lover,
suffersng exsseme peril, hardship, and humiliation in the service of
his lady to whom he is abjectly obedient.

Gumievre, the imperious lady, is also modeled on the,basis of
Ovidian preeepts and examples. If she was originally a Celti-e
faimmistress, her original character would have sex-ved as an ex-
cellent ground figure upon which the Ovidian type as Crestien re-
fashioned it could easily have been superposed.

Yvain

“ Yvain has many characteristics of the Ovidian lover. His lan-

guage and actions furnish sufficient evidence„

Laudine is another irnperious type, similar to Guenievre, though
less prohounoed. ,

Lunete is one of the finest descendants οἱ Ovid's Dipsas (Amores
1, 8, 2), Cypassis (Amores ΙΙ, 7, 17), and Nape (Amores 1, 11, 2),
to be found in literature, but lifted to a moral plane far above the
usual example of this type.

Peren-al

The heorine of the only love-episode in Perceval (1911 ff. oi
Baist’s text; Potwin, 3127 ff.) resembles Ovid's women by making
the love advances herself. She also shows the Ovidian love symp-
tems.
