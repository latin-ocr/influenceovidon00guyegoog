The Influmce of Ovid on Crestien de Troyes ²44

Crestien Legouais, the author of the Ovide moralisi, was a
prosaic and pedantic scholar σί the fourteenth century who took it
upon himself to explain and moralize upon Ovid's Metamorphoses.
He translated and amplified his model. Having at hand Crestien
de Troyes' translation οἱ the Philomela episode he preferred to use
that rather than make his own translation or adaptatiom and he
tells us that he has given a faithful copy of his predecessor's poem:

Mais je n'en descrirai le conte
Fors si eom Cretiens le conte,
Qui bien en translata la letre.

Sur lui ne m'en vueil entremetre5-
Tout son dit vos raconterai

Et l’alegorie en tmirai.¹⁷

This explains why he felt obliged to state clearly that he himself
added the statement zbout the house being in a wood. He had
noticed that Crestien de Troyes had failed to make the explicit
statement and as commentator he was unable to resist this tempta-
tion to elarify the text and at the same time make use of a conve-
nient rhyme with his own name. De Boer believes that Gois is the
name ο( the town of Gouais where he supposes that our Crestien
was born. In such a case the rhyrne with ¹¹ bois ’¹ would have been
impossible in the twelfth century and Crestien de Troyes could not
have written the lines. Moreover, Crestien named himself in Erec
Crestien de Troyes. We have proven Philumena a later work. It
is obvious that Crestien would not have named himself subsequently
after the small town of Gouais, Troyes being the capital οἱ Cham-
pagne. This iant alone proves that Crestien li Gois is not Crestien
de Troyes.

It follows {rom the above discussion that the translations from
Ovid mark a clear-cut break in the work of Crestien, as is proven by
the love treatment which is so different in Erec from that in all the

sitien that the annutztors who put the name οἱ Legouais on the mznuseripn
