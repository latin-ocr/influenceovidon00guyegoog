The Influence of Ovia on Cresh‘en de Truyes 1¹5

Incident 7 is almost certainly due to a suggestion from the
Amores. Here Ovid states that, if he were driving horses in a tace
under the eyes οἱ his mistress, he would be spnrred on to great
efforts; but ii he should happen to gaze upon her the teins would
fall from his hands. Then he cites the case of Pelops who was
nearly killed by his opponent while he was luoking toward his
mistress; and yet his final victory was due to the favor of his mis-
tress⁴ lancelot’s situation is similar. While looking baekward at
his mistress, and unable to take his eyes from her, he is in danger
οἱ being quickly killed, but when he manages to get Meleaganz be-
tween himself and the Quem he defeats his opponent because οἱ the
strength that the sight οἱ Guenievre gives him.

The passages follow:

Lam-eloe, 3691 Ne puis l'ore qu'il Vaparqut
· Ne se loma ne ne se mut
Devers li ses iauz ne sa chiere,
Ainz se deffandoit par den-iere.

3727 Lors saut arriere et iet son tor
Et met autre lui et la tor
Meleagant trestot a force

3738 lit io'rce et haraemar'lz li eruist',
Qu'amors li iet mont grant aie

Amor. Si mihi currenti fueris conspefflay mofflbor,
ΙΙΙ, 2, 13 De que meis manibus lora remissa fluent
At quam paene Pelops Pisaea considit hasta,
Dum spectat vukus, Hippodamia, tuos!
Nempe lavore suae vicit tamen ille puellae.
Vincamus dominae quisque favore suae!
