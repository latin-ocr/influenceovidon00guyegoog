The Influence of Ovia cm Creuien de Troyes ²3³

Once rid of this false conception, we may examine the situation
in our romance with the expectation οἱ understanding its psychol-
ogy clearly.

The theme οἱ Erec· is that οἱ love and“ sovereignty'¹ wounded l
by pride and misunderstanding—a theme of universal experiente ⁴
and therefore οἱ universal interest. The sovereignty is taken for ¹
granted—a thing that Chaucer could scarcely do, nor could Cres
tien have done so atter Ch'yks. Erec, slandered by his own sub-
jecte and former compa-nions, is angered by his wife’s disrespect
§or his sovereignty and deeply grieved by her disloyalty toward his
love for her and by her appearance of loving him much less than
hc had supposed. Restrained anger and grief well up in his heart
so that speech is impossible. He can only act. And yet Erec is at
no time unjust or cruel toward his wife—granted of course the cir-
cumstances and the authority οἱ a husband. He humbles her only
by way of reproof. Her service as squire is not unusual; she had
already served in a like capacity (451 ff.) when Erec first rnet her
at her (affier's house. Erec uses no violence nor any undignified
or injurious language toward his wife. In fact Crestien has dealt
so lightly and artfully with this interesting conjug-al problem that
he has kept our sympathy and admiration for both the rnan and the
woman.

The theme οἱ the slotht'ul lover was well known in Crestien’s
time on account of its frequent occurrence in Classical Latin liter-
ature.¹⁴ The best known example οἱ the love-sick hero was, of
course, Virgil's Aeneasfl In calling attention to this fact, Pro-
fessor Nitze has stated that the Dido-Aeneas situation is not that
οἱ Erec. The wide diver-genoe between the two situations is ap-
parent. The thane, however, is the same except that Crestien
carries it tarther and, instead οἱ separating the lovers, effects a re-
conciliation. In Virgil, the Dido story is a subordinate episode in
which the theme οἱ uxoriousness is used only as a reversal of the
hero's fortune in order to heighten the interest of the narrative;
whereas in Erec it is the main theme.
