2¹7 ’ The Romanic Review

that is, a literary communion, a romanoe. Crestien asserts that he
is going to use this romanoe to show

16 Que cil ne fet mie saveir

Qui sa sciance n’abandone

Tant con Deus la grace l'an done.
and

4 Por ce fet bien qui son estuide
Atorne a san, quel que il 1’et;

Thus our author shows the moral and intellectual value that he
attaches to his work quite apart from the mere story. He is writing
for inme as surely as any poet οἱ the sixteenth century:

24 (His poem) toz J'orz mes iert an mei-noire
Tant eon durra crestiantez;
De ce s¹est Crestiitns vantez.

He is deeply interested in the learning that has passed from the
Ancients into Franoe. He considers it his duty to cultivate that
learning in order that he may do an he can to increase it and keep
the honor οἱ it in France.⁸⁶

Learning was in Crestien' s mind the essential quality of a poet.
He applied his learning in Cliyes, Luncelot, and Yvain· to the study

f of love, which was, in his eyes, a science.

The recognized authority on matters of love m Crestien s time
was Ovid. The evidence in support of this statement is so well
known by scholars that its truth is generally recognized. We have
the actual statement οἱ Honorius of Autun,⁸³ a preacher of this
epoch, that the people οἱ his day who were interested in love read
Ovid. The great popularity of this poet in scholastic and court
circles of the late medizeval times is well known through the studies
