235 The Romanae Review

There can be no doubt that Erec has the sovereignty over his
wite!³ It is clear that he believes he should have it; tor he assume:
complete authority naturally and Enide as naturally submits to that
authority. Professor Nitze, believing the source of Erec to be

¹ Celtic, treats Enide as a rationalized iairy mistress. We are in no
way concerned with popular or Celtic sources, here. and therefore
do not need to consider whether Enide may have been a tairy in an
earlier version. We do need, howev‘er, to insist on Crestien’s artis-
tic ownership os this romanoe which is, unquestionably. one ori the
bost literary works of the twelfth century in France The important
fact for our particulzr problem is that Enide is not a fairy in
Crestien's story¹⁰ nor does she have Erec at any time under any
sort of control· except thzt οἱ love. It is very important to note,
however, that this cannot be the control that was exercised by later

people down to the most recent times. Courtly love was a literary
matter and its spread through high society was largely a litu-ary in-

It is not uncommon to find data gleaned from mediaeval romances,
in an attempt by historians to reconstruct the socia] history of the
twelfth century, turned about by students ot literature to serve as
supposed evidence of an historica] nature to aid them in solving
literzry problems.

Professor Sheldon (126) has noted the effectiveness of Cres-
tien’s art in portraying the natural timidity οἱ Enide before her
