²²7 The Romanic Review

Although Guenievre and Lancelot were cliaracters already exist·
ing in previous literature, Crestien has made them over. Lancelot
is as completely of the Ovidian type as a mediaeva] knighr could
well be. Guenievre may have been a salty-mistress originally but
in Crestien's romanee she has no personality and seems to serve in
no other capacity than that οἱ furnishing a lady to rescue and une
who with every sort οἱ impropriety personifies the suggestions that
Ovid offers for a haughty mistress reducing her lover to deepest
humility.

The following lines show Ovidian influence: 208. 364-81, 564- ⁴

77. 631-8‚ 7¹5—79, ¹24o-s4. Ι348-56, ι436-49, 1580-871312649·
3691-4. 3738-9‚ ³763-72„ 3816-30‚ ³955-98. 4232-5‚ 4249, 4261-5.
4276, 4336-4414. 4494-71 4501·9‚ 456oe3, 4695-470²› 4721, 4776-
81. The action οἱ lines 5658-5913. Crestien’s original adaptat-ion
of the story of the three days toumament, is arranged to develop
the theme that underlies the whole romance.

Leve is personifled as a god. It is treated metaphoricauy as a
sciente and as a disease. Crestien has copied Ovid's metaphor οἱ
night conquering day and also the figure of sailing and arriving in
port. There are love-monologues οἱ the Ovidian type

The source of erain has so far baffled the most ardent efforts
οἱ scholars' ln its search T'he attempts at explaining its orig-in have
been numerous and contradictory. ⁰⁹ Crestien refers vaguely to a
conte as his source:
