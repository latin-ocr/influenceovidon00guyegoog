The Influence of Om'd on Crestien de Troyes ’ ²4²

translated the Ars and had thus become familiar with this passage
from which he copied. Mox-cover, the expansion of the love-treat-
ment in Philumena on the basis of· the Ars amatoria, the Remedia
amoris, and the Amores poims in the same direction. Having then
just translated one or more οἱ these works already, it is natural
that Crestien should display his learning here to some extem⁴ It
might be argued that the shortness of Philumena could easily ac-
count for longer descriptions than those to be found in the longer
romanens. Crestien had no need to strive to keep Philumena short.
He probably wished rather to lengthen it by such means. At any
rate De Boer qualifles the description of the supper as a “descrip-
tion sommaire, cornme on en trouve beaucoup dans la litterature
du temps,” thus destroying his own argument.

3. “Moins de hardiesse dans l'emploi de certaines figures styl-

seems too rneager to constitute a very strong ease: “ l’emploi de la

second part of the poem, whereas, in Erec, he simply indicates the
end os the first part without naming himself (1844) and ixi Cliqes
the break is still less precisely indicated. To this should be added
the hypothesis that Crestiens li Gois was the name that our author
bore in his youth. De Beer places this break between a supposed
first and second part between lines 726 and 727, making the new
part start with “but'' and having the word “ il '¹ refer to Pandion,
who fades out of the story at this point, as the subject of the verb
in the first line, Moreover Pandion, who belongs only to the first

part, is carried across the dividing line to survive only through the ·

first line of the second part. De Boer would have us consider this
break clearer than that in Erec where we read:

Erec, 1844 Ci fine li premerains vers.
or that in Clige's:

Nez est Cliges an cui memoire
