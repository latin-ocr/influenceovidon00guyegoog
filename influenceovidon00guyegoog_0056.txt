22 5 The Romam'c Rcview

The main theme of the romanoe is that οἱ adulter-ons love ex-
alting the lady and debasing the man to a role of abject slavery to
the will of his mistress This theme is Ovidian⁴ Proveneal influ-
enees are certainly not to be denied, but Ovid is to be considered
as the principal source οἱ inspirationi ior the love treatment in this
romanee.

Briefly summarized, Gaston Paris givos the following descrip-
tion or analysis of the love in Crestien's Lam-eloh„ (1) It is ille-
gitimate and furtive. The lover {ears continually to lose his mis-
tress, to be unworthy of her, to displease her. (2) He is therefore
in an inferior position, always timid and trexnbling, while the lady
is mpricious toward hirn, often unjust, haughty, and disdainful.
(3) To be worthy οἱ her love, the man aeeomplishes all sons οἱ
brave deeds and she, on her side thinks always οἱ making him a
better lmight on account oi her love. (4) Love' is an art or science
with elaborate rules.

This analysis could be applied to Ovidian love with very little
modification. Gaston Paris wzs himself aware of this fact. Ovid’s
love is illegitimate and furtive, and love is always accompanied by
sear in his works. It is the danger and risk that make love inter-
esting and fascinating. Calm, quiet, assured love has no atti-action
{or Ovid. It rnust be enhaneed by the caprioe of the lady. Her
yielding must be delayed by changeableness, haughtiness and unjust
treatment. Moreover the {ear οἱ lesing one's mistress must oon-
tinually give zest to the gamer Ovid’s heroes are ready to endure
hardship or perform most difficult feats for the sake of winning
their ladies' love or to get into their presence. Love isan art and a
