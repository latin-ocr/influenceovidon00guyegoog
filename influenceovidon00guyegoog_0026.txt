strength without limitation, produced by love, is illustrated by
Lancelot's unrestricted promises to the maiden who directs hii-n and
his companion Gauvain in their pursuit οἱ Meleaganz (631 ff).
(3) Meneal absorption that leads to more or less serious disasters
occurs when Lancelot is carried into th‘e ford contrary to the ad-
monitiou of a lmight who then strikes him from his horse into the
water (715 ff), .(4) The attempt οἱ a young woman to seduee
Lancelot (942 ff.) may have been suggested by the frequent ap«
proaches made by women to obtain the love οἱ men in Ovid’s
works.¹⁴ (5) The sight oi some of Guenievre's hair iu the teeth oi
a comb that she has lest near a fountain nearly causes Lancelot to
faint. Fainting is one oi the symptoms oi the Ovidian love-sick-
ness. (6) Strength and courage to endure the deep cuts of the
sword-bridge are given to Lancelut by love (³¹2⁶ ff.) (7) Another
ease of mental absorption tending to partial mental derangemeut
occurs in the first toumame'nt, with Meleaganz when Lancelot is
obliged to deliver backward blows because he is unable to turn his
gaze away from the Queen (3691 ff). (8) An adaptation of the
Ργι-αηιης and Thisbe story iumishes an episode in our romanoe
(4153 ff). Lancelot is compared to Pyramus (3821). Both Lan-
celot and Guenievre are led to believe that the other is dead. Lance-
lot attempts suicide and Guenievre contemplantes it⁴ The fact that
neither accomplishes actual suicide cloes not lesseu the probability
that Crestieu is adaptiug Ovid's plot to his own needs.¹³
