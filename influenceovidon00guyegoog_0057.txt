The Influence of Ovidfln Crestien de Troyes 226

science {or which Ovid laid down most elaborate mles in his Ars
amatoria.

In only two respects does Paris' analysis differ from one that
might be made ot Ovid's treatment οἱ love. In Crestien and later
Freneh writers the code was taken more seriously and was accepted
as actual love doctrine, This situation is due to the spirit οἱ the
Middle Ages. Authority, convention, and tradition were strong
forces. The courtly love οἱ the Middle Ages had also the quality
οἱ idealization which was lacking in Ovid. Woman was raised to
a higher plane and love was supposed to strengthen and ennoble
courage and character. This clement of difference is due to the
differing religionst It was that trait οἱ idealimtion that needed to
be added to Ovidian love to make it acceptable to Christian civiliza-
tion. Crestien's genius lay in his appreciation of the psychoxogiml
interest of Ovid's material and in his ability to adapt the Latin
poet’s keen observations and sugg-suom, transforming Ovid's fie-
tions into a forrn that appealed to Christian taste.

Our study of the love situation in Crestien’s works shows that ,
the love treatment in ancelot is not very different from that in s
Cliqes. The difference lies in the attitude toward aduhery, in an-
exaggerated development of the theme οἱ the role of Love as tor· ,
mentor and absolute master transferred to the lady, and in the¹
change of emphasis {rom the physical effects οἱ love that are promi ἕν’,
nent in Cliyes but of much rarer occurrence in Lancelot to the ζ
slavish subserviente of the lover to his lady's will. Crestien has l
brought out different phazes of the Ovidian love conception in dii· i
ferent works.

Whatever may have been the plot at Crestien's comma-nd, it is
clear that, at most, such a {tamework could have served only as the
frailest sort of support for the real story as Crestien eonceived it.
Lancelot appears to be a story οἱ an abduction and rescue—whose
othei-world character implies a prcbahle Celtic source-upon which
has been hung a most incongruous love—situation. It is the super·-
irnposed burden that constitutes the literary value and interest ο(
the romance. All the episodes that bring out the humiliation of the
lover, his obedience to his lady or his mental absorption in his love

’ and the one that treats οἱ the thought οἱ suicide in the minds oi

both lovers are due to Ovidian influence.
