 

The Influence of Ovt'd on Crestien de Troyes ²3⁶

husband. He has explained admirably how Erec eurtly rewgnizee
her justificatior: and meanwhile forms a plan for testing her loyalty
(we substitute the term “loyalty’¹ for Professor Sheldon's “sin-
cerity‘¹) and for solving the doubts that she has raised in his mind
—a plan which he does not reveal to his wife at once. The plan is
also, of oourse for regaining his reputation as a valiant knight by
following his wife's admonition:

2566 Autre consoil vos convient prandre,
Que vos puissiez cest blasme estaindre
Et vostre premier los ataindre ς
Car trop vos ai oi blasmer;

for he realizes that he is under just criticism:

2576 ¹¹Dame1”, iet il, “droit an eiistes,
Et cil qui m'an blasment ont droit.¹¹

Erec now sisbjeets himself to the most difficult trians of his

knightly prowess, but his wife must go with him and together they .

will prove themselves worthy. Erec will govern, however, and
direct at all times; for he is in no sense a courtot's lover. He is
perseetly sure of himself and never admits that he was in the least
at fault in his attitude toward his wife He finally pardons her for
the injury she has done him:

4929 ⁴* Et se vos rien m'avez mesdite,
Jel vos pardoing tot et claim quite
Del forfet et de la parole.”

Crestieu makes it clear that he is ot the same opinion as Erec by
telling his readers at the opening of this episode that Enide

2487 . . . dist une parole,
Dont ele se tint puis por fole;

and, though she did not realize at the time that she was doing any
harm, yet she blamed herself bitterly afterward:

2606 Mes trop m'a orgiauz sozlevee:
An mon orguel avrai damage,
Quant je ai dit si grant outrage,
Et bien est druiz que je l'i aie.
