The influente vs Ovid on Cres-tien de Troyes 222

'suffering {rom lovesickness and loving a person denied to them by
law and custom; in each case a crime must be committed (in
Cliyes the crime is palliated by casuistry) ; in each case the young
lady hesitates to confess and the nurse discovers that the girl is in
love; both nurses plead hard, promise secrecy and every kind of
help, first to cure any malady by means ot medicine or sorcery (tor
both can furnish medical aid or magic), then to procui-e the love
desired by the maiden; and finally each is able to realize her prornise
of help (Cliyes, 3002 ff). To be sure, a great many divergencies
between the two episodes that we have compared could be enumer-
ated. That {act does not invalidate our argument; for it should
be remembered that Crestien gathers in various elements from dif-
ferent sources, mlngles the whole, transforms everything to suit his
own needs, adding much ot his own and, in accordante with the
literary method of the time, amplifying his material by frequent
repetition.

In C luges we have the physical effects of love especially empha
sized There, too the famous theory of love wounding the heartl
through the εγω is elaborated on the basis οἱ suggestions to be Κ
found· 1n the Narcissus story of the Metamorphoses (Ch'yes, 474ff
and M et 111, 430 ff. ). This source may not appear obvious at once
to all readers. A lit-Qexplanation, however, will make the matter
clear. First it 1s to be nond that Narcissus· 1s mentioned* in this
very romanoe( (2]671ἷ.) arid his story is told 1n brief and oom-
mented upon. This fact shows that Crestien was interested' in the
incident. Note also that Narcissus met his death at the hands of
his own eyes which he could not control. It should be realized
that Crestien is fond of turning his source about (cf. for example
his use of the Pyramus and Thisbe story in Yvain, 3490 ff.) or, as
here, of having his characters act in a manner exactly contrary to
those οἱ the vsource (ct⁴ for another case, that of Soredarnors
(Ctiqes, 460 ff.) resisting love instead of yielding as did Ovid in
Amores 1, 2, thereby incurring the punishment that Ovid esoaped;
this example is that of the whole drama that we have mentioned as
being constituted by Soredamors’ struggle with her love and which
covers her two monologues (B, Cliqaffir, 2, above); and the ”iotis
that we are considering as based on the Narcissus story is set within
